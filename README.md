# Crack
 
Crack Engine is a custom 2D action game engine developed in C++ using OpenGL.

This engine is built with data-driven development, allowing developers to change large amounts of content without having to compile any script.

With a robust animation system, fighting game enthusiasts can take advantage of in-depth features like per-frame timings, and accurate hitboxes and hurtboxes.

In-game content is driven using xml files that can be edited manually or using our in-engine tools, with all the features needed to execute a complex fighting game character, a challenging boss battle or an in-depth RPG story.
